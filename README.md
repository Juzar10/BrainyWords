## 👋 What's BrainyWords All About?

Ever find yourself searching for that *perfect* word? Or maybe you just love expanding your vocabulary in a fun and engaging way? Then BrainyWords is the app for you! 🎉

BrainyWords is a delightful Android application designed to help you discover new words, understand their meanings, and see them in action. Think of it as your personal pocket dictionary, but way more exciting! 🤓

**Here's what this little gem does:**

*   📚 **Fetches a list of fascinating words:** We've got a growing database of words ready for you to explore.
*   🧐 **Provides clear definitions:** Understand what each word means, no sweat!
*   🔄 **Shows you synonyms:** Find alternative words to spice up your language.
*   💡 **Gives you context with quotes:** See how words are used in real sentences, often from famous authors or sources.
*   👀 **Tracks your learning:** We keep a cheeky count of how many times a word has been viewed (globally, for now!).

This project is built using modern Android development practices, leveraging the power of:

*   **Kotlin:** For concise and expressive code.
*   **Jetpack Compose:** For building beautiful and reactive UIs.
*   **Firebase Firestore:** As our backend to store and retrieve all those lovely words.
